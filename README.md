## Overview and Origin

* Name of company: 
& vbCrLf & Acorns
* When was the company incorporated?: 2012
* Who are the founders of the company?: 
    Jeffrey and Walter Cruttenden
* How did the idea for the company come about?:
    At a the age of 11, Walter had taught Jeffrey the importance of investment wisdom. When Jeffrey went to college, he was "surprised at how many of my peers had interest in investing but couldnâ€™t overcome the barriers in their way, such as high minimum balance requirements and fees" (1). From there, he and his father worked together to make investing simple with a realistic and easy-to-follow approach. 
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?:
    Acorns makes money via subscription services:
    * $1/month = Allows members to invest their change into ETFs
    * $2/month = Allows members to create IRAs on the platform
    * $3/month = Members are provided with a debit card
    * $5/month = Family Plan

## Business Activities:
* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    For many people, no one has ever taught them how to invest. They don't know how to get started or will have the "I'll get to it eventually" mentality. Acorns helps people invest by rounding up to the nearest dollar for every purchase, then investing that extra into pre-built ETFs that people will choose based on their personal risk tolerance (1).
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
    Acorns is available and free for everyone to use, but their target audience is millennials. Millennials have a tendency to spend whenever they have money available, but they are also more inclined to electronically track where their money is going. Acorns fits into these natural habits well by simplifying the money spent and forcing millenials to put money away lit bits at a time.
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?
    The closest competitor to Acorns would be Stash. Both are FinTech investment apps that help beginner investors build an investment portfolio. Acorns rounds up on purchases and invests the difference, while Stash offers customers choices of investment funds with basic information and creative names. For example, there is a "Defending America" fund that invests in aerospace and defense companies (4). But Stash is closely related to normal investment acounts you might see through other companies. What sets Acorns apart from the herd is:
    * 1. Hands-off investing without any monthly commitment necessary
    * 2. Automatically reallocates funds based on portfolio diversity, age, and risk tolerance.
    * 3. Lower fund expenses, meaning lower costs
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?
    Acorns uses a number of hubs and platforms for their technology, but they lean heavy on Amazon Web Services. For their application and data, Acorns uses Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon CloudFront. For coding and development, they use Amazon EC2 Container Service and Amazon CloudWatch. But when it comes to the business side of the company, Acorns leans more on Google by utilizing Google Analytics and G Suite (5).

## Landscape:
* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
    Wealth Management
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
    Robo-advising and computer automation has been on the rise since the early 2000s. "Global assets under management (AUM) by robo-advisors were nearly $1.1 trillion in 2020, and they're expected to grow at an annual rate of 25.6%" (6). But instead of directly taking business from Wealth Management advisors, these financial services assist advisors with background work and offer additional communication and control for clients. "Surveys show that a high percentage of affluent investors and those under the age of 40 prefer to do business with investment firms that use online collaboration and digital tools" (6). 
* What are the other major companies in this domain?
    Chime - Online banking with no monthly or overcharge fees
    Stash - Investment app for beginner investors
    Robinhood - Finance app allowing people to invest in stocks and ETFs

## Results
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
    Acorns has raised millions from bankers such as NBCUniversal Media, PayPal, and Black Rock Inc. "yielding a valuation of $860 million as of its latest fundraising" (3). As of February 2020, Acorns is up 4.6 million user compared to this time last year, bringing the total number of users up to 6.8 million.
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
    One of the most popular metrics in this space is Assets Under Management (AUM). More specifically, a company's ability to attrach and sustain clients. Although Acorns does not have the AUM to compare to massive companies like Bank of America, with $1.3 trillion AUM, it's the AUM growth rate that is catching many investors' eyes. At the end of 2016, Acorns had $257 million AUM (2). Just 3 years later, Acorns has managed to increase that by over 500% to $1.3 billion.

## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    Acorns does a great job simplifying the investment process for beginner investors. For investors with more experience, their investment options can be somewhat limited and are generally conservative. I believe they should be able to take the next step and provide the ability to invest in individual stocks, stock options, or cryptocurrency. Putting the spare change away would add to the total amount in the portfolio, but investors should have more freedom into how that money is allocated.
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    As of now, investing in individual stocks are an untapped market for Acorns. This is continuing to allow apps like Robinhood to have competitive advantage over them. Acorns has a great business model set up and a proven method of helping people save and invest money. Although the customer base is growing rapidly, focusing on just the beginner investor limits the attractiveness for experienced investors.
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    The company would have invest in creating a user-friendly interface to search and purchase stocks. The amount of information they will make available to customers is up to them. The key to retaining customers is to make this interface as painless and simple as possible.
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    The selling point for this company has been the "set it and forget it" strategy and a user interface that keeps things simple and easy. Their main customers are beginner investors, some who have been dragging their feet to start investing. Any friction in this process could be enough to drive some away. The focus should be keeping that ease of access while adding an extra element for the ones with more experience.
